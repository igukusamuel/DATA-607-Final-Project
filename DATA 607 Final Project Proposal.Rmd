#### DATA 607 Final Project Proposal

I want to perform a study on health specifically wellbeing and population density.
I want to take advantage of the many data sources currently out there especially 
on the world bank and other international development agencies sites.
With so much data, it makes sense to use some sort of relational data base such as
MySQL to store the data.

Data can also be collected using an API for the different data sources (sites)
or downloaded directly into .cvs format files.

The data will most likely come from the sources in these following links: 
https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics 

The research question that I would like to address is
- is there a relationship between wellbeing and population density?

In answering this question, I endeavor to understand the relationship between health
and well being in relation to population densities.

I will carry out the project using a typical data science workflow presented in 
DATA 607 specifically in the Data Science for Business reading text.
